## Introduction
[NLP Demystified](https://www.nlpdemystified.org/)[^1] is a very well designed course that contains ~10 hours of video lectures, licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). It comes with nine Jupyter Notebooks which contain end-to-end examples written in Python. That was the motivator behind this project, i.e. I'd like to enrich my NLP knowledge through a course that masterfully balances theory with practice, using
Julia. 

This project is my approach to demystifying NLP, using the Julia programming language. It also acts as a demonstrator of the capabilities of Julia in the NLP domain. 
In this project, I'll be using the `mistral 7b instruct` Large Language Model (LLM) to summarise the course.  
Why do I want to learn traditional NLP, despite the ease of using LLMs?  
> It's easy to make something cool with LLMs, but very hard to make something production-ready with them.   
-- [Chip Huygen](https://huyenchip.com) 

Another very good point, which applies to less well established technology overall, states   
> A couple of people who've worked with LLMs for years told me that they just accepted this ambiguity and built their workflows around that. It's a different mindset compared to developing deterministic programs, but not something impossible to get used to.     
-- Chip Huygen  

If you have any suggestions, constructive feedback or additions, please open a Github issue. 

Enjoy!
