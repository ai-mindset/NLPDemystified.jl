## Introduction
[NLP Demystified](https://www.nlpdemystified.org/) [^1] is a very well designed course that contains ~10 hours of video lectures, licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). It comes with nine Jupyter Notebooks which contain end-to-end examples written in Python. That was the motivator behind this project, i.e. I'd like to enrich my NLP knowledge through a course that masterfully balances theory with practice, using
Julia. 

This project is my approach to demystifying NLP, using the Julia programming language. It also acts as a demonstrator of the capabilities of Julia in the NLP domain. 

If you have any suggestions, constructive feedback or additions, please open a Github issue. 

Enjoy!
